# FotoMichel

... is a simple PIC-controlles device on my modelrailroadlayout for triggering up to two flashes from photographers.
The Name 'FotoMichel' depends on the first module, where the device was used.
The flashes can be triggered manually or by an electronic contact e.g. a lightbarrier. One of the triggerinputs is optoisolated.
